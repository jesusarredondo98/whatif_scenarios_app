# Welcome to the "What-If Scenarios" App!

Dive into an interactive exploration of diabetes data with our demo app. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset that provides insights into diabetes progression and its key variables. Experiment with various "what-if" scenarios to see how different factors influence the outcomes and gain valuable understanding of the underlying patterns in diabetes management.

## Features

- **Model Visualization**: Visualize how adjustments to model parameters affect predictions and compare them with the original model.
- **Model Parameters**: Adjust and view the linear regression model parameters and see the impact on model performance.
- **Feature Importance**: Analyze the importance of different features in the linear regression model and visualize their contributions.
